## Difference between `exact path` and `path` in React Router

In React Router, the `exact` prop is used in combination with the `path` prop to define the behavior of route matching. Here's the difference between `exact path` and `path`:

- `exact path`: When you specify `exact` and `path` together in a `Route` component, it means that the specified path should match exactly with the current URL for the route to be considered a match. This is useful when you want to ensure that the route matches the URL exactly, without any additional segments.

  For example, if you have a route with `exact path="/"`, it will only match the root URL ("/") and not any other URLs that have additional segments. So, if your URL is "/about", the route with `exact path="/" will not be considered a match.

- `path`: When you specify only the `path` prop in a `Route` component without `exact`, it means that the specified path should be a partial match with the current URL for the route to be considered a match. This allows you to define routes that match URLs with additional segments or parameters.

  For example, if you have a route with `path="/products"`, it will match URLs like "/products", "/products/123", "/products/abc", etc. The route will be considered a match as long as the current URL starts with "/products".

To summarize, `exact path` ensures an exact match of the specified path with the current URL, while `path` allows partial matching of the specified path with the current URL, enabling additional segments or parameters to be present in the URL.

## What does "match" mean in the context of React Router?

In the context of React Router, "match" refers to the process of determining whether a given URL matches a specified route's path. When a URL is matched to a route, it means that the route's path pattern is satisfied by the current URL, and the associated component for that route will be rendered.

The matching process involves comparing the path of each route defined in your application's routing configuration with the current URL. React Router uses a matching algorithm to determine if there is a match and which route should be rendered.

The matching algorithm considers various factors, such as the exactness of the path, the presence of URL parameters or wildcard segments, and the order in which routes are defined. Based on these factors, the matching algorithm determines whether a route should be considered a match for the current URL.

When a route is matched, the corresponding component associated with that route is rendered, and any necessary route parameters or URL information can be accessed within the rendered component.

In summary, the "match" refers to the process of comparing the current URL with the defined routes' paths to determine if there is a match and which route should be rendered.
